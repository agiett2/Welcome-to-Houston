    <h2>Hello Midtown</h2>
    <p>Around 1906 what is now Midtown  was divided between the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Ward,_Houston,_Texas" title="Third Ward, Houston, Texas">Third Ward</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Ward,_Houston,_Texas" title="Fourth Ward, Houston, Texas">Fourth Ward</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown,_Houston#cite_note-3"></a>&nbsp;Before the 1950s what is now Midtown was a  popular residential district. Increasingly, commercial development lead  homeowners to leave for neighborhoods they considered less busy. The area  became a group of small apartment complexes, low-rise commercial buildings, and  older houses.
