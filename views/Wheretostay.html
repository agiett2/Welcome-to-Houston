  <article id="where"><h2>Lay It Down</h2><p>Houston may rank  behind&nbsp;<a href="http://lonelyplanet.com/usa/chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>&nbsp;as  the nation's fourth most populated city, but it covers a greater area than all  of&nbsp;<a href="http://lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>.  Diverse residential neighborhoods and enclaves of restaurants and shops spread  far and wide. You'll miss out if you limit yourself to Downtown. The leafy  Museum District is the city's cultural center; Upper Kirby and River Oaks have  upscale shopping and dining; Montrose contains cute bungalows, quirky shops and  eateries;&nbsp;<a href="http://lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city/midtown" title="Midtown">Midtown</a>&nbsp;has up-and-coming condos and some good  restaurants; Washington Ave is nightlife central and the Heights has historic homes  and boutiques. Don't forget that a couple of the town's main attractions –  NASA's Space Center Houston in&nbsp;<a href="http://lonelyplanet.com/usa/texas/clear-lake-around" title="Clear Lake">Clear Lake</a>&nbsp;and  Galveston Island – are outside the city limits, requiring a 45-minute drive  down I-45.</p>
<p> Though Houston is a  sprawling city, much of its nightlife is concentrated in a few distinct  neighborhoods. The city has invested heavily in the Downtown neighborhood in  recent decades, and it's now home to many of Houston's newest bars, nightclubs  and theaters. West of Downtown, the Montrose neighborhood is home to most of  the city's gay and lesbian venues, and a fair share of largely straight hot  spots as well. The Rice Village, south of Montrose, is popular among college  students and young professionals. Farther to the west, along the western side  of the 610 Loop, is the Galleria area, also known as Uptown. It houses more  than 700 retailers, and the neighborhood is home to some of Houston's larger  nightclubs.</p>
