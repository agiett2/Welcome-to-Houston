    <h2>Downtown History</h2>
    <p>Downtown  Houston was the original founding point of the city. After  the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Revolution" title="Texas Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>, two New York real estate  promoters,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_Allen" title="John Kirby Allen">John Kirby Allen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_Chapman_Allen" title="Augustus Chapman Allen">Augustus Chapman Allen</a>&nbsp;purchased 6,642  acres (2,688&nbsp;ha) of land T.F.L. Parrot (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Austin_(soldier)" title="John Austin (soldier)">John Austin</a>'s widow) for $9,428.[<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></em>]&nbsp;The  Allen brothers first landed in the area where the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Oak_Bayou" title="White Oak Bayou">White Oak Bayou</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bayou" title="Buffalo Bayou">Buffalo Bayou</a>&nbsp;meet,[<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></em>]&nbsp;a  spot now known as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_Landing" title="Allen's Landing">Allen's Landing</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Borden,_Jr." title="Gail Borden, Jr.">Gail Borden, Jr.</a>,  a city planner, laid out wide streets for the town.<br>
      The city was granted incorporation by the Texas legislature on  June 5, 1837. Houston was the temporary capital of Texas. In 1840, the town was  divided into four wards, each with different functions in the community. The  wards are no longer political divisions, but their names are still used to  refer to certain areas. By 1906 what is now Downtown was divided among six  wards. <br>
    Downtown's growth can be attributed to two major factors: The  first arose after the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston_Hurricane_of_1900" title="Galveston Hurricane of 1900">Galveston Hurricane of 1900</a>, when  investors began seeking a location close to the ports of Southwest Texas, but  apparently free of the dangerous hurricanes that frequently struck Galveston  and other port cities. Houston became a wise choice, as only the most powerful  storms were able to reach the city.</p>
